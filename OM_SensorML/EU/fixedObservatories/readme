One short term objectifs to be able to manage fixed observatories descriptions in SWE standards.
The targeted platforms are:

- POSEIDON moorings (http://www.poseidon.hcmr.gr/eurosites/about.php) : in JERICO projects the description of POSEIDON moorings is being translated in sensorML (with IFREMER/MARUM/HCMR). For SeaDataNet a user friendly web editor will be developed.
An example of a formal description of M3A mooring (to be implemented in sensorML) is given in spreadsheet format:
poseidon-m3a-sensorML-example.ods

the format is documented in details in:
jerico-observatory-mooring-description.odt

- MOMAR seabed observatories (in french: http://www.ifremer.fr/momarsat2010/instr_obsmomar.htm): for FIXO3 project, the platform/intruments description in sensorML is prepared. The observations themselves will also be managed as O&M records.
