VAIMOS is an autonomous sailing boat with embedded instrumentation for ocean surface measurements.

A student is preparing sensorML and O&M records from the datasets collected during previous experiences. Eventually the conversion software (C) may be deployed on the control system on-board (ARMADEUS: http://www.armadeus.com/english/index.html) so that observations are directly sent from the platform in SWE standards.

As in previous experiences at sea, one record is generated every 30mn.

Examples of the sensorML and O&M records are given in XML.
The C routine creates O&M records in JSON.
